I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, specializing in AIoT. My research focuses on harnessing wireless sensing technologies to enable smarter living environments, with applications in smart homes and elderly care.

Beyond academia, I have hands-on experience in software project development, equipping me with both theoretical expertise and practical skills in building innovative solutions. Additionally, I am deeply interested in the intersection of FinTech.

With a strong technical foundation and a passion for cutting-edge research, I am always eager to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that bridge AIoT and real-world applications.
